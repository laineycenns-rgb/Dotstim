# Random Dot Experiment
## Overview
This psychophysical experiment measures participants' ability to detect motion direction in a field of moving dots. Participants indicate whether a collection of moving dots moves left, right, or, in some trials neither, appearing as a collection of random directions. After each trial, participants rate their confidence in their response.

## Experiment Design
### Trial Types:

#### Motion Trials: 
The dots move in a coherent pattern, either left or right. The experiment randomizes varying coherence levels across trials: 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, and 80% coherence. 
#### Catch Trials: 
These trials appear equivalent to the trials per condition of the coherence levels (if it is a 12-trial experiment, there will be two trials per condition, including the catch condition). They have a 0% coherence level, making them appear as a sporadic collection of moving dots. This completely random motion test is in place to "catch" if the participants are guessing without reason. If one or both catch trials are incorrect, it can imply poor attention to the experiment and a random guessing approach. 

### Independent Variables

#### Coherence Level: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 (proportion of dots moving in the same direction)
#### Direction: Left (180°) or Right (0°) (from center)

### Dependent Variables

#### Response: Participant's directional choice (left/right/none)
#### Reaction Time (RT): Time to make a directional response
#### Accuracy: Whether the response matches the correct direction
#### Confidence Rating: Self-reported confidence (1-4 scale)
#### Confidence RT: Time to provide confidence rating

### Trial Structure
#### Each trial follows this sequence:

1. Fixation cross (0.5-1.5 seconds, randomized)
2. Dot motion display (until response)
3. Confidence rating screen (1-4)
4. Inter-trial interval (0.5 seconds)

#### 12 trials = 1 repetition × 6 coherence levels × 2 directions 
#### 60 trials = 5 repetitions × 6 coherence levels × 2 directions = 60 trials
#### 120 trials = 10 repetitions × 6 coherence levels × 2 directions = 120 trials
#### 180 trials = 15 repetitions × 6 coherence levels × 2 directions = 180 trials
